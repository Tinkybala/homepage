<h1>Homepage</h1>
This is a  basic homepage that incorporates almost everything I have learned to this point
<h2>Newly learnt things I have incoporated</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Transitions/Animations</li>
  <li>Responsive Design: the layout works on both phone and pc displays</li>
</ol>
Something to improve on is the accessibility: color contrast, keyboard navigation
